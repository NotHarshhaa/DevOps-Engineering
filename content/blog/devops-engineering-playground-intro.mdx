# 🧪 Inside the DevOps Engineering Playground

Welcome to the **DevOps Engineering Playground** — my personal sandbox where I build, break, automate, and learn. This is not your typical enterprise-grade setup. It’s raw, evolving, and driven by curiosity more than compliance.

In this post, I’ll take you behind the scenes: what this repo is all about, what’s under the hood, and how you can learn or build alongside it.

---

## 🎯 Why This Playground Exists

There are countless DevOps tools, services, and patterns out there. It's easy to fall into **tutorial hell** or get stuck reading docs without ever shipping or breaking anything.

This repo exists to flip that script. I wanted a space where I could:

- Prototype infrastructure with **Terraform**, **Pulumi**, and **CloudFormation**
- Test **CI/CD workflows** using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Jenkins
- Learn and fail (and learn again) with tools like **Kubernetes**, **Ansible**, **Vault**, and more
- Document my experiments like a lab notebook

---

## 🧰 What You'll Find Here

Think of this like a working DevOps lab. Here's a preview of what's inside:

- ✅ **Infrastructure Modules**  
  Modular and reusable code to spin up AWS/GCP resources with Terraform and Pulumi.

- ✅ **CI/CD Experiments**  
  YAML pipelines that build, test, deploy — sometimes even rollback 😅.

- ✅ **Kubernetes Stuff**  
  Helm charts, manifests, local clusters with k3d or kind, and some autoscaling trials.

- ✅ **Secrets & Security**  
  Vault integrations, IAM sandboxing, and automated secret rotation scripts.

- ✅ **Observability Stacks**  
  Logs and metrics with Prometheus, Loki, Grafana, and ELK/EFK setups.

- ✅ **Bash & Python Scripts**  
  Handy CLI tools, automation wrappers, and even some chaos engineering basics.

## 💻 Sample Workflow: GitHub Actions + Terraform

Here’s a simplified example of one of my CI/CD workflows:

```yaml title="terraform-ci.yaml"
name: Terraform CI

on:
  push:
    paths:
      - "infra/**"

jobs:
  terraform:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Terraform
        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2
        with:
          terraform_version: 1.5.0

      - name: Terraform Init
        run: terraform init

      - name: Terraform Plan
        run: terraform plan

      - name: Terraform Apply
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        run: terraform apply -auto-approve
```

This is just one of many experiments. Some are working, some are a work-in-progress, and a few are intentionally broken so I can test alerts and failure handling.

## 🌱 What I’ve Learned (So Far)

- **Version everything** — Infra, secrets, configs, dashboards. Treat everything like code.
- **Don’t over-engineer** — Simple pipelines beat complex, brittle ones.
- **Monitoring isn't optional** — You don't know what’s broken if you can't see it.
- **Keep it fun** — If you're not curious, you're just doing chores with YAML.
