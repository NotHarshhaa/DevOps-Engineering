# DevOps Engineering Playground

Welcome to my **DevOps Engineering** Playground ‚Äî a personal space dedicated to learning, experimenting, and evolving as a DevOps engineer.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This is *not* a production-ready toolkit. It's a hands-on lab environment where I try new ideas, test tools, break things on purpose, and explore how to glue technologies together in meaningful ways.

## üß≠ Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is **exploration and growth** in the DevOps field. It serves as a digital notebook and lab bench where I:

* Experiment with various DevOps tools and practices
* Design and iterate on custom CI/CD workflows
* Practice infrastructure automation with tools like Terraform, Ansible, etc.
* Build out observability stacks for logging and monitoring
* Learn by doing ‚Äî through trial, error, and iteration

## üß∞ Areas of Exploration

This repo contains practical experiments in the following areas:

| Area                              | Tools / Concepts                       |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**  | Terraform, Pulumi, AWS CloudFormation  |
| **Configuration Management**      | Ansible, Chef, Bash scripting          |
| **Containers & Orchestration**    | Docker, Kubernetes, Helm               |
| **CI/CD Pipelines**               | GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI     |
| **Cloud Platforms**               | AWS, GCP, Azure (selectively explored) |
| **Monitoring & Logging**          | Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack         |
| **Security & Secrets Management** | HashiCorp Vault, SOPS, IAM policies    |
| **Scripting & Automation**        | Bash, Python, Makefiles                |

## üß™ What's Inside

This repo includes:

* ‚úÖ Modular Terraform configurations
* ‚úÖ Sample CI/CD workflows (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
* ‚úÖ Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts
* ‚úÖ Bash and Python scripts for automation
* ‚úÖ Notes and documentation of what worked (and what didn't)
* ‚úÖ Demos of observability stacks
* ‚úÖ Experiments with self-hosted tools and services

## üöß Disclaimer

This is a **learning environment** and not intended for production use. Some components may be partially implemented, outdated, or intentionally broken for learning purposes.

## üìö Future Goals

* Build a robust, reusable base infrastructure module
* Experiment with GitOps workflows using ArgoCD or Flux
* Try out policy-as-code tools like OPA / Conftest
* Set up zero-trust networking or service meshes (e.g., Istio)
* Simulate incident response scenarios
